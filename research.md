    <u>Modeling of Cortical Color Responses</u><br>
    Examine the represetnation of color stimuli in early visual cortex through the use of fMRI. The goal of this project is to present subjects with targeted light spectra in order to model the cotical sensitivity to various color directions. Using parameterized fits to these voxel sensitivities, we will examine how these parameter vary based on factors such as eccentricity and visual area.

    <u>Modeling of Retinal Ganglion Cell Displacement</u><br>
    Model the lateral displacement between cones and retinal ganglion cells in the human retina. Correcting for this spatial displacement is needed to relate measurements of ganglion cells to measurements of cones, perception, and cortex. We have developed a spatial model that solves for RGC displacement at any arbitrary retinal position.  The goal of this model is to use individual subject data to link measurements of cone and RGC density to visual function and cortical organization.

    <u>Predictive Atlas of High Level Visual Areas</u><br>
    Category selective functional regions of interest (fROI) were used to create maximum probability maps (MPM) of ventral temporal cortex. Using cortex based alignment, I registered these MPM fROIs to an average cortical surface and used a leave one out analysis that allowed for the quantification of the spatial predictability of these fROIs.

  <div class="four">
    <u>Function and Cytoarchitecture</u> <br> 
    Created cortical mesh reconstructions of post-mortem human brains in FreeSurfer based on hand segmentations. The surfaces were used to create maximum probability maps (MPM) of cytoarchitechtonic regions of interest (cROI) in the fusiform gyrus. I created a pipeline using the cortex based alignment tools of FreeSurfer to register these MPM cROIs to individual living subjects. For the first time, this allowed the quantification of proportion overlap of category selective regions of VTC and its cellular composition.

    <u>Development of Perception</u><br>
    A longitudinal research study examining human high-level visual cortex in children (5-12 years old) and adults. From this study, we found growth of tissue within portions of ventral temporal cortex, challenging the idea that cortex is either quiescent or pruned after early childhood. This tissue growth within face-selective cortex, is correlated with increases in the functional selectivity of face-selective regions and linked to improvements in recognition memory ability well into adulthood. To do this study, we combined quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques with functional MRI and behavioral measurements in single-subject analyses. We have also linked these measures with ex vivo quantifications of cytoarchitecture.
